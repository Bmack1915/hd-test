## Before you start

Here are a few things weâ€™d like you to keep in mind:

1. Our development tech stack includes Next.js, SCSS, and TypeScript, in case youâ€™re considering which technologies to use. However, youâ€™re not required to use this exact stack.

2. The time limit for the task is 24 hours. Please complete as much as you can within this timeframeâ€”weâ€™re primarily interested in seeing your approach to the problem.

## Tasks

### Task (UI)

Your task is to build out this news website homepage in React ( any React framework ) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users (website visitors) should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Task 02 (CMS integration)

Your task is to integrate the UI with a mock CMS (Content Management System) backend with REST API. You will find the instructions to run the CMS Backend in this document.

Your user (website content editor) should be able to edit the content in the backend and it will be reflected in the UI without making any change in the front end code

## Front-end : Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design.

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

All the required assets for this project are in the `/assets` folder. The images are already exported for the correct screen size and optimized.

We also include variable and static font files for the required fonts for this project. You can choose to either link to Google Fonts or use the local font files to host the fonts yourself. Note that we've removed the static font files for the font weights that aren't needed for this project.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Backend : Server setup

You will find the backend code in the "backend" folder. Please update the `imageUrl` property in the data variable in the server.js file with the appropriate image file.

### Server startup instructions

1. Open command line and go into the "backend" folder.
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`

Your backend will be available at port 3002 and you can access data at "http://localhost:3002/data"

## Building & submitting your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. Clone this folder in to your local.
2. Create your app in the "my-app" directory.
3. Once done, you can push your app into your own Github public repo (or similar) and share the link with us. No need to push other directories (backend & fron-end). Just your code will do.

**Best of luck & have fun building!** ðŸš€
